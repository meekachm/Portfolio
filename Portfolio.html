    <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
    <h3>So, who am I?!</h3>
        <p>I am a mature student who has spent the majority of her life struggling to make ends meet as a single mother. Despite the fact that I had become accustomed to it, I was tired of this way of life living paycheck to paycheck. I came to the decision to go back to school and complete my high school education when I realized how old and independent my daughter was getting. After completing high school and earning my diploma, I decided that I wanted more, so I went to college to pursue a nursing degree. But after working at a nursing home, I saw that I was unconsciously terrified of infectious deseases, which caused me to be anxious about any possible symptoms I might have. I knew I needed to change my educational path, and I was certain I didn't want to quit school, so I chose something I grew up with and loved... video games! More precisely, a look behind the scenes, coding!
        <p>I am now a student currently majoring in Applied Computer Science at Dominican University of California. I was also one of the few chosen individuals who was given the opportunity to take part in the Shopify Dev Degree Program.</p>
